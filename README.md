# Number Classification Program

This Dart program demonstrates how to work with lists and perform number classification. It creates a list of random integers, iterates through the list, and identifies whether each number is even or odd and whether it is positive or negative.

- **🔄 Looping**: Uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list.
- **🧮 Number Classification**:
